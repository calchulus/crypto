From inside the `examples/loanbot` dir:

```
python loanbot.py 'your-api-key' 'your5uper5ectetH4ash'
```

### What the bot does:  
* First the bot turns __off__ auto-renew on all _active_ loan orders.  
* It then loops the following __every 10 min__ until asked to stop:  
  - checks all open loan offers to see if they are 'stale' (older than _30 min_)
  - if an offer is sale, it cancels the offer (making them available in 'lending')
  - the bot then gets current 'lending' account balances
  - checks if the balance of each avail coin is enough to make a decent sized offer
  - finds the current lowest asking rate for each coin we are lending
  - creates a loan offer slightly better then lowest asking rate `6 * loantoshis` `loantoshi = 0.000001`
  - it then prints the current active loans
